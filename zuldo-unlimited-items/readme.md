# 4D-Miner-unlimited-items
A [4D Miner](https://4d-miner.github.io/) recipe "mod" that lets you get unlimited items from one stick. Intented to make resource acquisition not-a-problem, for people who just want to build.

# How to install
Move the `unlimited-items/recipes.json` file into the game's directory, such that it replaces the current `recipes.json`.

# How to uninstall
Move the `vanilla/recipes.json` file into the game's directory the same way as above.

Alternatively, you can use Steam's "Verify integrity of files" function, but this will also return any other changed JSON files to their original state.
